This is a Rust Multi Tool website, where you can calculate the time left for a wall to decay based on It's material, and a recycler calculator, to put in any item and amount, and check what it gives you back, and how many.

## Decay Calculator

The Decay Calculator helps you estimate the decay rate of structures in your Rust base. Simply input the relevant information about your base, and it will provide you with an estimate of how long it will take for each component to decay.

## Recycler Calculator

The Recycler Calculator assists you in determining the recycling output of various items in Rust. Enter the items you want to recycle, and it will display the resulting resources you'll obtain from recycling those items.
